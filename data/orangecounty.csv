Owner occupies rear property. This is a real RENTAL BY OWNER, not a scam or 'come-on' by a listing agent., Month-to-Month (w/30-day notice), but hopefully long-term rental. Short-term OK also., Available after January 1, 2021 prorated to the first of the month., Deposit to match monthly rent, plus $150 utility deposit., Utilities (City water bill, gas, electricity) paid to owner (prorated to coincide with rents)., Get a $90 monthly credit to offset rear property utilities (avg. $45/mo usage) while occupied., There will be a non-refundable application fee of $35/first adult, $25/additional adults – undisclosed tenancy will void rental contract., Why the low price?, Home is old and in somewhat poor condition, but improving it only raises the value/rent and people need low cost rent these days. Zillow suggests rent (assuming standard conditions) of $2,850., Home is normally 4bd/1ba, but has been closed off to only allow 2bd/1ba (the remainder is used for owners' storage w/separate access)., Home is single family detached, but shares front yard and utilities with the rear property., No backyard access available, so no pets can be allowed for this rental., No garage. ONE designated parking space on-site. Additional street parking can be in high demand., Tenant agrees monthly to conditions being acceptable for the rent/price. It is what it is and it ain't for everyone, but it's a house., Includes:, 2 bedrooms or 1 bedroom and 1 office/den/storage room, 1 bathroom, Laundry room, Living room w/cast iron fireplace (Franklin stove), Dining room/area, Kitchen w/dining area or storage space, Front porch, 1 designated, uncovered parking space on-site, Unfurnished.
